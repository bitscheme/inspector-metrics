value (e.g. \"how many time was my function called, number of bookings in a sales system\")\nMonotoneCounter - a monotonically increasing integer value (e.g. \"error count\")\nEvent - ad-hoc event to report events (e.g. \"application start / deployment\", \"batch import started / ended\")\nGauge - measurement of a value (e.g. \"number of waiting threads on a resource\")\nHdrHistogram - recording and analyzing sampled data value counts across a configurable integer value range with configurable value precision\nHistogram - measures the statistical distribution of all values\nMeter - measures the rate of events over time (e.g. \"requests per second\")\nTimer - measures call-rate of a function and the distribution of the duration of all calls\n\nThere are libraries which collect some metrics:\n\nnode VM - collects memory & garbage collection metric for node VM\n\nThe library ships with a default console MetricReporter.\nSome other reporter:\n\nAMQP\nCarbon /
